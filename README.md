# CptS455-Sockets
This is a simple little two-way client-server chat app via sockets that runs on localhost.

## To install:
- download the two python files
- run in separate terminals (in order) as ```python sockserver.py``` and then ```python sockclient.py```
- begin chatting or sending files (note that the chat is in sequence, in order of client->server->client
